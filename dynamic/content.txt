A brief description of what district energy is; 1 - 3 sentences. More if necessary. see line 9.
	• Neighborhood energy (or district energy, as it is also known) is a centralized heating and/or cooling system located on one site that serves multiple neighboring buildings.  There are over 6000 of these systems in the US.

A few factoids related to the project - Did you know? Every house is being/has been weatherized for energy effeciency.
	• These houses are all between 60 and 120 years old.    
	• One of these houses uses 1/10 as much energy as the neighbor next door.   
	• Collectively we spend about $1600-$1800 per month to meet our thermal energy needs (space heating and hot water).  
	• Only one of these houses has central air conditioning.    
	• 40 people live on this block, ranging in age from 1 to 75.
	
Information regarding the implementation of weatherization. Why was this done?
	• We believe conservation is the best energy investment.  Negawatts before megawatts.  We don't want to invest a bunch of time and effort to create our own clean, green energy if it is just going to trickle out of people's leaky old windows and uninsulated walls.
	
Full description of what district energy is.
	• Neighborhood energy systems connect all the places in a community - such as schools, churches, businesses, and residences - in a common thermal energy grid. A central plant heats water which is then distributed throughout the neighborhood in underground, insulated pipes. End users install thermal transfer equipment (air handlers, radiators, etc.), allowing them to heat air and domestic water from the incoming hot water supply.  In the US, it is common to find district energy systems on college campuses, in industrial parks and downtown areas.  In the last 30 years, European countries have pioneered the development of smaller-scale applications of the technology, creating neighborhood energy utilities tying together detached single family homes, schools, churches, etc.
	
Description of where to project is currently at as well as where it's been and where it's going - what's the next step?
	• I am serving as a liaison for the block to both existing and new weatherization programs being offered by the city and county.  We hope to have all homes on the block weatherized by the end of the summer.
	
Description of any problems currenlty hampering progress. These could be either technology or promotion related. People could post suggested solutions.
	• Haven't identified the most cost-effective combination of technologies to meet thermal demand.  Need some engineering pre-design in order to estimate system costs so that we can start building some budget pro formas and look for financing.
	
Content of similar projects and how successful they became
	• Drake Landing Solar Community (www.dlsc.ca) is probably the closest to what we're proposing.  This community of 52 homes meets 90% of its thermal energy needs using stored solar energy.  Their borehole seasonal thermal storage system is basically a giant insulated thermal battery underground.  Solar thermal panels collect the sun's energy when it's shining, pump this heat underground, and then draw off of the thermal battery to provide space heat and hot water.  This thermal battery can store heat for months at a time.  (I will keep looking for other examples and include them as appropriate.)
